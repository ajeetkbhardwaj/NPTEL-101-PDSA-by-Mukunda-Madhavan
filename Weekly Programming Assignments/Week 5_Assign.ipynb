    "> Write three Python functions as specified below. Paste the text for all three functions together into the submission window. Your function will be called automatically with various inputs and should return values as specified. Do not write commands to read any input or print any output.\n",
    "* You may define additional auxiliary functions as needed.\n",
    "* In all cases you may assume that the value passed to the function is of the expected type, so your function does not have to check for malformed inputs.\n",
    "* For each function, there are normally some public test cases and some (hidden) private test cases.\n",
    "* \"Compile and run\" will evaluate your submission against the public test cases.\n",
    "* \"Submit\" will evaluate your submission against the hidden private test cases. There are 15 private test cases, with equal weightage. You will get feedback about which private test cases pass or fail, though you cannot see the actual test cases.\n",

    "> Here are some basic facts about tennis scoring: A tennis match is made up of sets. A set is made up of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To win a set, a player has to win 6 games with a difference of 2 games. At 6-6, there is often a special tie-breaker. In some cases, players go on playing till one of them wins the set with a difference of two games.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tennis matches can be either 3 sets or 5 sets. The player who wins a majority of sets wins the match (i.e., 2 out 3 sets or 3 out of 5 sets) The score of a match lists out the games in each set, with the overall winner's score reported first for each set. Thus, if the score is 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 it means that the first player won the first set by 6 games to 3, lost the second one 5 games to 7 and won the third one 7 games to 6 (and hence won the overall match as well by 2 sets to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "> You will read input from the keyboard (standard input) containing the results of several tennis matches. Each match's score is recorded on a separate line with the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Winner:Loser:Set-1-score,...,Set-k-score, where 2 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 5\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, an input line of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Osaka:Barty:3-6,6-3,6-3\n",
    "indicates that Osaka beat Barty 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a best of 3 set match.\n",
